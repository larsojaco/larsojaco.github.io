				<div class="col-6">
				
				<img src="img/help11.jpg">
					<h2>1. Get involved</h2> 
				Take a few minutes to contact your political representatives and the media to tell them you want immediate action on climate change. Remind them that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will also build healthier communities, spur economic innovation and create new jobs. And next time you’re at the polls, vote for politicians who support effective climate policies.
				
				</div>
				<div class="col-6">
				</br>
				<img src="img/help01.jpg">
				<h2>2. Be energy fficient</h2> 
				You already switch off lights — what’s next? Change light bulbs to compact fluorescents or LEDs. Unplug computers, TVs and other electronics when not in use. Wash clothes in cold or warm (not hot) water. Dryers are energy hogs, so hang dry when you can. Install a programmable thermostat. Look for the Energy Star® label when buying new appliances. </div>
				<div class="col-12"><br></div>
				<div class="col-6">
				<img src="img/help02.jpg">
				<h2>3. Choose renewable power</h2> 
				Ask your utility to switch your account to clean, renewable power, such as from wind farms. If it doesn’t offer this option yet, ask it to. By understanding the current and potential environmental issues associated with each renewable energy source, we can takes steps to effectively avoid or minimize these impacts as they become a larger portion of our electric supply.
				</div>
				<div class="col-6">
				<img src="img/help03.jpg">
				<h2>4. Eat wisely</h2> 
				Buy organic and locally grown foods. Avoid processed items. Grow some of your own food. And eat low on the food chain — at least one meat-free meal a day — since 18 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions come from meat and dairy production. Food writer Michael Pollan sums it up best: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.”</div>
				<div class="col-6">
				<img src="img/help04.jpg">
				<h2>5. Trim your waste</h2> 
				Garbage buried in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Keep stuff out of landfills by composting kitchen scraps and garden trimmings, and recycling paper, plastic, metal and glass. Let store managers and manufacturers know you want products with minimal or recyclable packaging.
				</div>
				<div class="col-6">
				<img src="img/help05.jpg">
				<h2>6. Let polluters pay</h2> 
				Carbon taxes make polluting activities more expensive and green solutions more affordable, allowing energy-efficient businesses and households to save money. 
				<br><br><br></div>
				<div class="col-6">
				<img src="img/help06.jpg">
				<h2>7. Fly less</h2> 
				Air travel leaves behind a huge carbon footprint. Before you book your next airline ticket, consider greener options such as buses or trains, or try vacationing closer to home. You can also stay in touch with people by videoconferencing, which saves time as well as travel and accommodation costs.
				</div>
				<div class="col-6">
				<img src="img/help07.jpg">
				<img src="img/help08.jpg">
				<h2>8. Get informed</h2> 
				Follow the latest news about climate change.
				</div>
				<div class="col-12"><br></div>
				<div class="col-6">
				<img src="img/help09.jpg">
				<h2>9. Green your commute</h2> 
				Transportation causes about 25 per cent of Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions, so walk, cycle or take transit whenever you can. You’ll save money and get into better shape! If you can’t go car-free, try carpooling or car sharing, and use the smallest, most fuel-efficient vehicle possible.
				</div>
				<div class="col-6">
				<img src="img/help10.jpg">
				<h2>10. Support and Donate</h2> 
				Many organizations are working hard on solutions to climate change and rely on financial support from citizens like you. Consider making a donation today.</div>
